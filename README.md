# simple_calculator
This is a modular command-line calculator for basic arithmetic (+,-,*,/) on lists of numbers. It features tokenization and division-by-zero error handling.

Unique Logic: The program collects all numbers from the expression and applies only the last operator found to that list. It performs multi-number addition, subtraction (first minus rest), multiplication, or sequential division. This approach means it does not follow the standard Order of Operations(PEMDAS/BODMAS).
